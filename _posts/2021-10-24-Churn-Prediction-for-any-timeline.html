<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Introduction</strong></span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Banking and financial institutions are facing severe challenges due to fraudulent transactions. 2015 alone saw a $21.84 billion fraud losses on credit, debit and prepaid cards. An article published in <a href = "https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogeraitken/2016/10/26/us-card-fraud-losses-could-exceed-12bn-by-2020/" target="_blank">Forbes</a> predicts that this could grow by 45% by 2020. Traditional approach of using rules and authenticating transactions is no longer a viable method due to the plethora of payment channels and adept criminals. Machine learning enables to detect and recognize patterns on customer’s purchase history efficiently even on larger datasets.  Using machine learning for fraud detection is no longer a trend, it’s a necessity.</p>
<p>In this post, we will be looking at implementing a logistic regression model for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions.

<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Dataset</strong></span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dataset used in this post is from <a href = "https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/home" target="_blank">Kaggle</a>. It consists of credit card transactions of two days belonging to European cardholders. Due to confidentiality issues, the original features were transformed to principal components. The features given in the dataset consists of 28 principal components along with the variables, time and amount. 'Time' is the time difference in seconds between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset. 'Amount' refers to the transaction amount. The response variable, ‘Class’ is a binary variable indicating 1 for fraudulent transaction and 0 otherwise.

<p>The recall and F-1 score are satisfactory. The ROC is also closer towards the top border indicating the model is effective.</br>
Can think of any other ways to predict fraudulent transactions? Build the model and let me know the recall value in the comments!</p>
